#ISS - Intergalactic Space Shooter 

A small Shoot'em up game in space, made with [enchant.js](http://enchantjs.com/) to help me to learn JavaScript.

Like every shoot'em up the goal is to destroy the ships coming up and survive.

There is only the 'Arcade Mode' for the moment (no levels, score as far as you can).
